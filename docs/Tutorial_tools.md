# How to use tools in GUI

## Shorten Videos
This is a tool to trim videos using ffmpeg. It contains **Method 1** and **Method 2**

### Method 1 
Method 1 has the freedom to cut from the beginning of the video and from the end of the video.

Let's say we have a 2 minute long video and we want to get rid of the first 10 seconds and the last 5 seconds of the video.
We would start our video on the 10th second `00:00:10` and end at `00:01:55`.

1. First, select the video to trim, click on `Browse File`

2. Enter the time frame in `Start at:` entry box, in this case it will be *00:00:10*

3. Enter the time frame in `End at:` entry box, in this case it will be *00:01:55*

4. Click
