# SimBA

Several excellent computational frameworks exist that enable high-throughput, consistent, and unbiased scoring of freely moving animals. Yet limitations related to ease of use, generalizability, and hardware-requirements impede the widespread implementation of the computational analysis of complex social behaviors such as aggression. Here we address these issues by designing SimBA (Simple Behavioral Analysis), a pipeline for developing classifiers for aggression-related behaviors:  
- The pipeline requires no programing knowledge 
- Specialized commercial or custom-made equipment is not required
- Extensive annotations are not required
- The pipeline is flexible and can be used to create and validate classifiers for different behaviors and environment
